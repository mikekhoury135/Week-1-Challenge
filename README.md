# Code Refactor Starter Code

By Michael Khoury

For this assignment, I have done the following things to improve the original code:

-Updated the title of the page
-Repurposed some div's to more semantic elements such as:
  -header
  -nav
  -main
  -aside
  -footer
-removed footer class and retargeted css to footer element
-consolidated classes for the main element to content cards
-consolidated classes for aside element to benefit
-combined css properties to match up with the aforementioned class changes
-added comments around the css changes I made
